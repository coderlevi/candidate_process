System Design

The application consists of:

Public API for prospects to submit leads (POST /leads) with details.
Email sending logic to notify both the prospect and the attorney when a lead is submitted.
Protected Internal API for attorneys to view and update leads:
GET /leads
List all leads
GET /leads/{id}
Get specific lead details
PUT / leads/{id}/resume
Update lead resume, and change the state to PENDING
PUT /leads/{id}/state
Update lead state (PENDING or REACHED_OUT)
Authentication for internal APIs (simple API Key-based auth for demonstration).
Persistent storage: Using SQLite (via SQLAlchemy ORM).
Resume upload: Storing uploaded file contents in the database as BLOB (for simplicity). In production, we can store the file in Azure blob.
